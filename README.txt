[1. Button Settings]
Set inputs for player 1 and player 2 respectively.
Most input devices are supported.
Game restart needed if you switch devices.
Can also support keyboard input, but having both players using the keyboard may result in ghosting and is not advised.
If inputting joystick directions, horizontal and vertical are only important for identifying the axis, left or right don't matter.
When binding buttons, make sure the button isn't also bound to another functionality.

Here is the default keyboard layout :
P1
move : wasd
A : r
B : t
C : y

P2
move : arrows
A : b
B : n
C : m

start doesn't do anything yet


[2. Menus]
-Main Menu :
either player presses A to go to character select screen

-Character Select Screen :
each player can move left or right to select a character.
confirm selection with A
cancel selection with B
pressing B will return to main menu if you have not selected anything yet
the score displayed in this screen is the number of wins
when both players have selected a character, the match will begin


[3. Gameplay]
A - attack. startup : 6. active : 4. recovery : 45. blockstun : 43. static difference : -5
B - throw. startup : 3. active : 2. recovery : 30. tech window : 3.
C - super. costs 50% gauge. You get gauge when you block. skill depends on the character.
Dash - Moves you forward during 15 frames, then 10 frames of recovery. Can be cancelled into attack or throw, not block.
Sweep - startup : 12. active : 3. recovery : 60. blockstun : 43. static difference : -16

Attacks have pushback on block.
First to 5 points wins.
Timeout and trades give a point to both players, unless one player would win from this point. It's the closest thing to a comeback mechanic, by giving the losing player an advantage to drawing things out.

[4. Known Bugs]
-hitbox controllers tend to glitch out when switching between forward and backward
-punishing sweep on block displays "Whiff Punish" instead of "Punish"

-well there's also a big to-do list. please look forward to it.
