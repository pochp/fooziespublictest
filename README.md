### To Do ###
* Timer Display, Round win count display (not as ongui)
* Specials
* Character select screen
* Controller select options (joystick or keyboard. Maybe I could just enable everything at once and add the axis values??)
* Creating some simple sprites

### Bugs/QOL ###
* Make hitbox color change for both players, change when in startup/recovery, needs more feedback for what's happening
* Limit sides of screen a bit more.
* Investigate bug where sometimes a held direction isn't registered after changing inputs fast.
* Fix and increase throw tech pushback, show visual feedback too.
* Tech throw automatically on throw startup.
* I think slightly reducing walk back speed would be worth trying.
* Render before determining winner
